<h1 align="center">React-CRUD-to-do-list üëã</h1>

## Intro

As rite of passage, I put a to-do list together with the intention of learning React and Redux. I really enjoyed this because I just kept adding new features to it and just had a lot of fun. I also had a look at Chakra-UI as a component library. I used local storage to persist the data, and used Redux to handle the CRUD actions.
